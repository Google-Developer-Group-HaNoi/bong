## Features

- **Real-time VLM Web App**: Supports both voice input and output for interactive experiences.
- **Multimodal Model Integration**: Utilizes Gemini 1.5 Flash for handling diverse inputs including audio, images, videos, and text.
- **Google Ecosystem Utilization**: Employs Google's API and WaveNet TTS for enhanced communication capabilities in Vietnamese.
- **RAG Workflow**: Incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation to keep the app updated with event information and GDG Hanoi news.
- **Natural and Humorous Responses**: Designed to engage attendees with real-time, context-aware interactions.

## Technical Details

### Model and Processing

- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: A lightweight model optimized for speed and efficiency at scale, supporting up to 1M context lengths.
- **Multimodal Input**: Accepts inputs from webcam videos, microphone speech recognition, and other media types.
- **Google Cloud's WaveNet TTS**: Enhances the app's ability to communicate naturally in Vietnamese.

### Workflow

1. **Embedding Extraction**: Uses Google Text Embedding API to extract embeddings from text information on URLs.
2. **Chain Construction with LangChain**: Constructs a system prompt incorporating conversational history for memory caching.
3. **Real-time Response**: The web application responds in real-time despite noisy environments and multiple individuals in the frame.
